Data types are different ways that the computer represents information. Some data types are more useful that others
depending on the situation. For example, it's a lot better to represent prices for an object with numbers rather
than words. ex) $12.50 is better than twelve dollars and fifty cents.

This section will explain what those different representations are and some of their uses.
