"""
There are a few different ways that computers represent numbers.
The two main ways that I'll talk about are
Integers
Floats

Integers are numbers with no decimal points so, 1, 913414, -30, 0

Floats are numbers with decimal points: 3.14159, .5, -3.9
"""


"""
Integers

You can modify these numbers as you would normally on a calculator
+: addition
-: subtraction
*: multiplication
/: division
**: powers (2**5 is 2^5)

Age = 22
Height = 31

x = 15
y = 30
addition = x + y
multiplication = x*y
subtraction = x - y
division = x/y

"""
Floats

Floats have same methods (ways to modify it) as integers, or ints. Floats are basically numbers that have
decimal numbers. ex) 1.0, 0.2, .00004, ect.)
