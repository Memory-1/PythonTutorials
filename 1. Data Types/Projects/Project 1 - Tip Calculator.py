Tip Calculator

In this project you will make a simple tip calculator. The result should be the bill total + the tip.

It will take two inputs from the user. I use input() which will prompt you to enter something in.

Take those two inputs. Divide the percentage by 100 to get a decimal number and then

This project will help you get familiar with numbers - both floats and integer number types.
You will be using multiplication (*), division (/), and addition (+). There are examples for these in the examples

# Remember - We talked about numbers and it's methods

price = input("Bill total?")
tip_percentage = input("Tip Percentage?")   # This will be a number like 10 or 12.5.

# TODO: 1. Convert the tip percentage to decimal (Remember that 75% = .75)

# TODO: 2. Calculate the total price

# TODO: 3. Print out the results
