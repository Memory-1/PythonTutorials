## Background

This project is designed to be a quick intro and reference for those wanting to learn python and some of the basics 
to get started programming.

I hope that this will be simple and to the point. I'll try to cut out extra fluff and provide meaning examples with 
plenty of explanations. 

I've seen other programming tutorials where they overly complicate it and inflate it with needless things. 

I'm going into to go into thinking back on when I first started learning how to program and remember what worked and 
what didn't.

 Background:
* Programming: what it is and isn't.
* How to think and approach it
* Definitions

1. Data Types
    * Numbers and how to represent them - (ints, floats)
    * Using words, letters - (Strings and characters)
    * Collections
        * Ones that you can change and add to (Lists)
        * Unchangable ones (Tuples)
        * Key-Value pairs (Dictionaries)
2. Logic and Making the computer to all the work
    * Setting conditions (If statements)
    * repeating and doing things over and over
        * Knowing exactly how many times to repeat (for-loops)
        * Keep going until some unknown time (while loops)  
3. Functions
    * What are they and how they work
    * What they're used for. 
    * Best practices
