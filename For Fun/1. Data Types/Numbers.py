"""
There are a few different ways that computers represent numbers.
The two main ways that I'll talk about are
Integers
Floats

Integers are numbers with no decimal points so, 1, 913414, -30, 0

Floats are numbers with decimal points: 3.14159, .5,
"""


"""
Integers

You can modify these numbers as you would normally on a calculator
+: addition
-: subtraction
*: multiplication
/: division
**: powers (2**5 is 2^5)
"""

Age = 22
Height = 31

x = 15
y = 30
z = x + y
z = x*y
z = x - y
z = x/y
"""
Floats

Floats have same methods as ints
"""

"""
Other things to be away of:

* modulus or mod, done by using %
