Iterate: To go through each item in a collection.

IDE: Integrated development environment - It's a nice editor for programming. Think of microsoft word for programmers.
    Pycharm is my favorite for python.

String: A word or collection of letters recognized by the computer. To designate a string use "" or ''
    Example: "Hello World"
             'abcdefg...'

Function: Code which can be re-used in different settings.
    This is used to avoid having to retype your code.
    Also, it's allows you to split up your project into chunks
    (Typically it's a good idea to make your function only work on one part of your project)
