What Is Coding?

I think of coding as writing an instruction manual for the computer to complete a certain task.
If you have ever read through (well-written) instructions, then you knew exactly what you needed to do at each step.
The same goes for coding!

One key difference though is that computers don't have common sense. It doesn't know what you were trying to imply if
you don't specify it precisely. That is one challenge that arrives with coding is being able to think sequentially through
each step of task precisely. Rest assured though, this is a skill and I believe any person can acquire a skill through
practice and diligence.

One example of how might one think while coding is illustrated through a question and answer:
How would you make ramen on the stove?
    1. The simple answer would be: I boil water and then put the noodles in and then wait until they're soft
    then eat them.

        But if you told this to a computer then how would it know where to get the water? What temperature should the
        stove-top be set to? How long to cook them?

    2. A more exact way would be: Fill pot with water. Set on stove. Set stove to medium temperature. If starts to boil
    add noodles. If the noodles are soft, remove pot from heat. Get bowl. Pour noodles from bowl.

Basically a rule of thumb would be to try to split up hard complex tasks into smaller, simpler tasks. If you can do that
then you'll be able to piece them together and get a real nice results. :)
