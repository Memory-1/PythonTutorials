"""
First off, all the words inside of these triple quotation marks are something called comments. These will be ignored
when the program first runs. Comments are basically ways to write down stuff to convey to others reading your code.
Comments can also be done using a #. Anything on that line after the # will be ignored by the computer.

First thing that will help you to see your program do something is the
print() command.

print will display something in the output.

To run this program, right click 'hello world.py' on the left and click "Run hello world" about
halfway down.

The code which will be executed will be on lines 27-29

You should see down below something like this after running your code.:

    /usr/local/bin/python3.8 "/Users/kylesmith/Code/Tools/Physics/PythonTutorials/For Fun/0. Background/hello world.py"
    Hello World
    Your name is YOUR NAME

You are welcome to edit what is inside the quotation marks below (like inside the print() or in the Name variable )  to have it print whatever you
would like.
"""

### CODE HERE ###
print("Hello World")
Name = 'YOUR NAME'
print("My name is " + Name)


"""
Use print() to see what are in some variables. 

Variables might give some of you flashbacks to middle school algebra where you had to solve for x.
Simply put, variables can be used to hold something else: numbers, words, or many other things.

As you can see, I stored the string "Your Name" inside the Name variable. Variable names can be anything (except 
for starting with numbers)
