dot accessing:

    If you have some object (A string, list, etc...) you can call functions that will modify what called it.
    For example:
        list_object.append(item)

        * list_object - The object which is calling the function
        * .append() - The function which will modify list_object
        * item - the parameter for the .append method


    Some objects will have variables stored in them, others will have functions that they can do.
    You can access these private variables by using .

    For example:
        Say we have a person object. we could access the private variable "name" by doing
        person.name and that will return the name stored in person
        We could call a private method yawn()
        so person.yawn() will cause the person to yawn.

Classes:
    A class is a representation of some object. You could think of any object and think of what can be used
    to describe it. For example,

        A car has:
            model
            make
            color
            radio stations
            owner
            miles
            etc...

    These are useful when you need to make your own representation of something for your project

Libraries:
    Python is great! Many other people have contributed to it and have made their own collection of code and published
    it! That means you don't have to program everything to graph out data, or someone's made it so you can make a
    webpage quickly.

    These libraries can be used by
        1. Downloading them using pip or pypi
            * This is done in your ide and clicking on the terminal tab at the bottom.
            * Usually this command follows the for
                pip install 'library_name'
        2. Added them to your python file.
            Simply declare it at the beginning of your file doing
            import "library_name"
            or if you want to import just one thing from the library use from
            from math import square_root

        Note: There are a lot of libraries that come standard with python, you still need to import those at
        the start of your python file. Some important ones are:

            * JSON (A way to convey data between programs)
            * MATH (Has various things such as square root, PI, and probably sin/cos stuff
            * PANDAS (Not standard, but a great way to hold data. It's like a spreadsheet with columns. no visual editing these)
            * REQUESTS (Allows you to make http requests such as get, post)
            * DATETIME (A class for representing time)

Variables:
    Variables might give some of you flashbacks to middle school algebra where you had to solve for x.
    Simply put, variables can be used to hold something else: numbers, words, or many other things.

    Variable names can be anything (except for starting with numbers)

    Variables can be called as much as you wish, they can be re-assigned over and over again. Some examples of how
    variables might be used:

        * a = 1 + 2
        * b = a - 5
        * a = a + 2
        * c = a * b
        * Name = "Bob"
        * Price = 1.50
