Well, here you are. We've done data types, logic and loops, and lastly functions. The big question is, what's next?
This was is about the extent of what I've had planned. I hope that you feel like you now have the tools to
be able to start learning more on your own; Or, that you feel that you can start creating what you want!

There are many different things to learn and it all depends on you. I will list some different things and I'll
leave it up to you.

Data Structures - Now there are more ways of representing data besides strings, or numbers, or lists. Some of these
might include a tree or a linked list. These different data structures have some incredible application for things
such as sorting or looking for something to name a couple.

    * Queues
    * Linked List
    * Trees
    * Graphs
    * Hash Maps

Recursion - This is calling a function inside of itself. This can be interesting once you get your head wrapped
around the principle. Basically you will have some base case and every time the function calls itself it
gets a step closer to the base case. I will make an example of recursion in this folder for your benefit.

Requests - This is how your browser communicates with websites. They make a network request and the website returns
what is request. One project that I mentioned that I did in the tips was a NASA image of the day getter. This
used requests.

Another part of requests that goes hand-in-hand are API's. This is how a website defines what a user can access.

Packages/Libraries - These are called different things depending on what programming language that you're
using. In python, they're called libraries. A library is some code which someone else has made which will make
your life much easier. People have made libraries for:

    Whatever is in [ ] are the names of the libraries for that thing.

    * Making Video games [pygame]
    * Network Request [requests]
    * Making really nice graphs/data visualization [matplotlib, plotly]
    * Machine learning
    * Making your own api
    * Doing really impressive data organization (Like excel sheets in a way) [pandas]

Classes - Classes are a way of describing one big thing. The example I like to use is a car. If you think of a car
it has certain properties: The color, make, model, etc... Then a car can do certain things such as: turn on,
accelerate, use blinkers, use wipers, etc... This is basically what a class in coding is. A way of making an
object that has certain properties and functions. I will have an example of what a class is in this folder

Algorithms - I think it's important to have some understanding of different algorithms that exist in coding. These
algorithms are basically rules for solving a certain problem most efficiently.

    Some different category for algorithms are:

    * Sorting algorithms:
        * Quick sort
        * Selection sort
        * Merge Sort

    * Searching Algorithms:
        * Binary Search (I really like the concept behind this one!)
        * Breadth first search
        * Depth first



Honestly, these are all important topics in computer science. I feel like knowledge of these will help you on
your journey. Even if you arent always using the topics in dsecribed above, they will help you think of things in new
ways.

Finally, I appreciate you! I believe in you! As I've said before coding is about gaining scar tissue.
Thank you for downloading my tutorial!
