These are some tips that I've picked up along the way. Some I've picked up from others, and others, I've figured out
myself.

"""

"""
Tip 1 - Chunk it!

When you're programming, it's best practice if you can break up your code into smaller sections. 

Instead of writing all of your code in one function like. You can write multiple functions 

Example
def calculate_something(var1, var2, var3, ...):
    part1 = compute_x(var1)
    part2 = compute_y(var2)
    part3 = compute_z(part1, part2, var3)
    return part3
    
Basically a problem can keep being broken down into smaller and smaller parts. This will help you 
isolate the issue if your code isn't working. 

It also helps me organize my thoughts

"""

"""
Tip 2 - Naming is hard

I've found that naming functions and variables is difficult. The right name will help with readability and let 
others be able to understand your code. A function name of add_two_numbers() is a lot more intuitive than my_function()

If you get in the habit of naming things clearly, I promise you that you will save yourself hassle in the future. 


"""

"""
Tip 3 - Use comments

Sometimes you'll find out a clever way to solve a problem. It may have taken a while for you to think of this sweet
solution. When others read your code, they may not be able to quite understand what you did there. 

For any confusing/complex/difficult to understand code, I would suggest putting a comment near it explaining simply
what you did. I've had other people's code which I've looked at and had no clue what their code does. They
had no comments, didn't name anything very clearly. It was awful. Please do not be that person.

"""

""" 
Tip 4 - Find what works

Find what works for you. Personally, I like to write stuff down on paper to work through a problem. White boards
are really nice too. 
Some people like to talk to an inanimate object such as a rubber duck. Or talking to a friend, even if they don't understand
coding, has helped me a lot. 

I think this is because in our heads, we're able to do some mental gymnastics to justify why our code is correct. 
Most of the time I've found when I have to say things outloud, I can hear what I'm actually saying instead of what
I think I'm saying. This sounds confusing, but it works. 

"""

"""
Tip 5 - It's not the code, it's you

If you ever thing that the code/programming language/code package is busted and isn't working. 
I've found that almost every single time, it was me that was doing incorrectly. Not the code.
Please try to stay humble and realize that it was probably you who messed up.

"""

""" 
Tip 6 - Something's fishy

I had a teacher who had a law he followed called "Judy's Law". Judy's law goes something like this: 
If you're working and you have the thought "huh, that seems weird, it's probably nothing" or "That will go away"
It is something, and it won't go away. It's easier to catch it and fix something in the moment rather than down the line
after a couple months when that problem comes back and messes up a lot more stuff. Usually if you ignore it, 
you'll forget where in the it originated from and you'll spend a lot more time trying to figure it out. 

Don't forget Judy's law. 

"""

""" 
Tip 7 - Just google it

I had a buddy who's professor would always say "just google it" whenever they went to them for help. Honestly, there
are so many resources out there when you get stuck. Many people have probably had the exact same issue or challenge 
that you're experiencing. 

I've found that a lot of coding is googling. Learning how to google efficiently is definitely a skill I would 
suggest trying to cultivate. 

Also stackexchange.com, w3schools.com are usually great sources on how to do something. 

"""

"""
Tip 8 - Practice makes perfect

Like any skill, it improves through repetition and practice. If you want to get better, you gotta keep pushing
yourself. Try to choose some project that feels slightly out of your league. This will force you to get better.

I usually say "coding is about gaining scar tissue" 

Some places that I would suggest to practice are: 

hackerrank.com, solo learn on iOS and android, hackerearth.com, or just search "coding practice" 

"""

"""
Overall, have fun. Try to find what interests you. The more excited you feel to work on something, the more likely
it is to get done. 

A few projects that I've done and have really enjoyed are: 

Making image getter to get the image of the day from Nasa's website
Making a discord bot to play among us in real life
A replica of the german enigma encryption device from World War 2.
